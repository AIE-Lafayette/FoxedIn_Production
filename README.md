The claw machine you are residing in is being restocked! 
<br/>
Move, Jump, Dodge, Swipe the boxes to avoid getting crushed!

Breaking a box awards a small amount of points, completing a row of boxes earns a massive amount of points!
<br/>
Don't let the boxes reach to top either as the restocker will notice you!
